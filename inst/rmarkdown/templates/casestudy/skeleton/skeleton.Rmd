# Identification of Role and Scenario

## 1. Read the first and last sections of the case.  

What is your first impression of the case?  
  

## 2. Scan over the exhibits and major section headings.  
  

## 3. Take a moment to reflect rather than read.  

What is the **core scenario** of the case?  
  

What does the we need to do?  
  

- Do we need to make a decision?
- Do we need to evaluate a situation?
- Do we need to diagnose a problem?
  

What is the **major uncertainty**?  
  
&nbsp;

***
# Criteria Selection

## 4. What do we need to know to resolve the major uncertainty?  

List the things you need to know (don't worry about being wrong):

- 
- 
- 

## 5. Go through the case, skim sections, and/or mark places where you find information that corresponds to the list above.  

- 
- 
-

# Criteria-Based Analysis

## 6. We're ready for a deep dive.  

Carefully read and analyze the information you've identified as **relevant** to the things you need to know.  

As you proceed in your analysis ask, "How does what I'm learning help me understand the main issue?"  

  
&nbsp;

***
# Overall Evaluation  

## 7. Your ultimate goal is to arrive at a position or conclusion about the case's main issue, backed by evidence from the case.  

Remember, there are usually no objectively right answers to a case. The best answer is the one with the strongest evidence backing it.  

  
&nbsp;

***
# Identification of Contingencies
  

## 8. Consider major contingencies that may have a significant impact on your position.  

Contigencies should not prevent you from taking a definitive position, but should call out a legitimate possibility.   

  
&nbsp;

***
# Recommended Actions

## 9. What actions does your position support or require?  

Consider your analysis and write down thoughts about an action plan with short term and long term action items.
