# Identification of the Subject

## 1. Read the first and last sections of the case.  

What do they tell you abou the core scenario?  
  

## 2. Take a quick look at the other sections and exhibits to determine what information the case contains.  
  

## 3. Stop! Now is the time to think rather than read.  

What is the **core scenario** of the case?  
  

What does the main character need to do?  
  

What is the **major uncertainty**?  
  
&nbsp;

***
# Criteria Selection

## 4. What do you need to know to accomplish what the main character has to do or to resolve the major uncertainty?  

List the things you need to know about the situation (don't worry about being wrong):

- 
- 
- 

## 5. Go through the case, skim sections, and/or mark places where you find information that corresponds to the list above.

# Criteria-Based Analysis

## 6. You're ready for a deep dive.  

Carefully read and analyze the information you've identified that is **relevant** to the things you need to know.  

As you proceed in your analysis, ask, "How does what I'm learning help me understand the main issue?"  

  
&nbsp;

***
# Overall Evaluation  

## 7. Your ultimate goal is to arrive at a position or conclusion about the case's main issue, backed by evidence from the case.  

Remember, there are usually no objectively right answers to a case. The best answer is the one with the strongest evidence backing it.  

  
&nbsp;

***
# Identification of Contingencies
  

## 8. Consider major contingencies that may have a significant impact on your position.  

Contigencies should not prevent you from taking a definitive position, but should call out a legitimate possibility.   

  
&nbsp;

***
# Recommended Actions

## 9. What actions does your position support or require?  

Consider your analysis and write down thoughts about an action plan with short term and long term action items.
