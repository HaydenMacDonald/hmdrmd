# Identification of Role and Scenario

## 1. Read the first and last sections of the case.  

What is your first impression?  
  

## 2. Skim over the exhibits and major section headings.  
  

## 3. Take a moment to reflect rather than read.  

What is the **core scenario** of the case?  
  

What do we need to do?  
  

- Do we need to make a decision?
- Do we need to evaluate a situation?
- Do we need to diagnose a problem?
  

What is the **major uncertainty**?  
  
&nbsp;

***
# Criteria Selection

## 4. What do we need to know to resolve the major uncertainty?  

List the things you need to know:

- 
- 
- 

## 5. Skim the case again, marking sections where useful information could be found.  

- 
- 
-

# Criteria-Based Analysis

## 6. Carefully read the case. 

As you read the case, ask, "Does this content help me understand the core scenario?"  

  
&nbsp;

***
# Overall Evaluation  

## 7. Compare the **relevant** information from the case against the criteria you have selected.

Consider the weights of the criteria. Not all criteria may be equal in your evaluation.  

Arrive at a position or conclusion about the case's main issue.  

The best solution to the major uncertainty is the one with the strongest evidence.  

  
&nbsp;

***
# Identification of other uncertainties
  

## 8. Consider major assumptions and conditions that may have a substantial impact on your position.  

These assumptions and conditions should not prevent you from taking stance on the case, but should bring attention to other possible outcomes.

# Recommend an Action Plan

## 9. Given your position, what should we do?  

Write an action plan with short-term and long-term action items.
