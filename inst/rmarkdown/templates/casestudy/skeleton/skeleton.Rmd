# Identification of Role and Scenario

## 1. Read the first and last sections of the case.  

What is your first impression of the case?  
  

## 2. Scan over the exhibits and major section headings.  
  

## 3. Take a moment to reflect rather than read.  

What is the **core scenario** of the case?  
  

What does the we need to do?  
  

- Do we need to make a decision?
- Do we need to evaluate a situation?
- Do we need to diagnose a problem?
  

What is the **major uncertainty**?  
  
&nbsp;

***
# Criteria Selection

## 4. What do we need to know to resolve the major uncertainty?  

List the things you need to know (don't worry about being wrong):

- 
- 
- 

## 5. Skim the case and mark sections where you could find information corresponding to the criteria above.  

- 
- 
-

***
# Criteria-Based Analysis

## 6. Carefully read and analyze the information you've identified as **relevant** to the things you need to know.  

As you read the case, ask, "Does this content help me understand the core scenario?"  

  
&nbsp;

***
# Overall Evaluation  

## 7. Compare the information from the case against the criteria you have selected.

Consider the weights of the criteria. Not all criteria may be equal in your evaluation.  

Arrive at a position or conclusion about the case's main issue, backed by evidence from the case.  

Remember, there are usually no objectively right answers to a case. The best answer is the one with the strongest evidence backing it.  

  
&nbsp;

***
# Identification of Contingencies
  

## 8. Consider major assumptions and conditions that may have a significant impact on your position.  

These assumptions and conditions should not prevent you from taking a definitive position, but should bring legitimate possibilities to your attention.   
  
  
&nbsp;

***
# Recommended an Action Plan

## 9. What actions does your position require?  

Consider your analysis and write an action plan with short-term and long-term action items.
