# Role and Scenario

## 1. Read the first and last sections of the case.  

What is your first impression?  
  

## 2. Skim over the exhibits and major section headings.  
  

## 3. Take a moment to reflect.  

Who is the main character?  

When is the case taking place?  

Where is the case taking place?  

What is the **core scenario** of the case?  

What is the **major uncertainty**?  

What do we need to do?  
  
- Do we need to make a decision?
- Do we need to evaluate a situation?
- Do we need to diagnose a problem?
  
&nbsp;

***
# Criteria

## 4. What do we need to know to resolve the major uncertainty?  

List the things you need to know:

- 
- 
- 

## 5. Skim the case again, marking sections where useful information could be found.  

- 
- 
- 
  
&nbsp;

***
# Analysis

## 6. Carefully read the case. 

As you read sections in the case, ask, "Is this content relevant to the core scenario?"  

  
&nbsp;

***
# Evaluation  

## 7. Compare the **relevant** information from the case against the criteria you have selected.

Consider the weights of the criteria. Not all criteria may be equal in your evaluation.  

Use tools, analyses, or frameworks to arrive at a position or conclusion about the major uncertainty.  

The best solution to the major uncertainty is the one with the strongest evidence.  

  
&nbsp;

***
# Uncertainties
  

## 8. Consider assumptions and conditions that may have a substantial impact on your position.  

These assumptions and conditions should not prevent you from taking stance on the case, but should bring attention to other possible outcomes.   
  
  
&nbsp;

# Action Plan

## 9. Given your position, what should we do?  

First, who is the action plan for? Who is our audience?  

What is the final deliverable to our audience?  

Write an action plan with short-term and long-term action items.
